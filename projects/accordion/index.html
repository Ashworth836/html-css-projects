                    <p>Accessibility is a crucial aspect of web development. Ensuring your website is accessible means that it can be used by as many people as possible, regardless of disability or impairment. This includes individuals with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive disabilities. By implementing accessible design and coding practices, you can create a better user experience for all visitors.</p>

                    <p>Styling your website enhances its visual appeal and reinforces your brand identity. Consistent use of colors, typography, spacing, and imagery contributes to a cohesive and professional look. However, it's essential to balance aesthetics with functionality. Keep your design clean and intuitive to ensure users can navigate your site easily.</p>

                <div class="tab-content">
                    <p>Animation can enhance user engagement and bring your website to life. From subtle transitions to interactive elements, animation adds a dynamic touch to your design. However, use animation judiciously to avoid overwhelming or distracting your audience. Focus on meaningful animations that guide users through the interface and provide feedback on their actions.</p>
