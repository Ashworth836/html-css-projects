                This is an expandable widget created using HTML and CSS. It consists of a header section and a content section. When the user clicks on the header, the content expands smoothly to reveal additional information.
                <br><br>
                The header contains a title and a sub-title. The title represents the main heading of the widget, while the sub-title provides additional context or information about the widget's content.
                <br><br>
                The content section can include text, images, or any other HTML elements. In this example, Lorem Ipsum text is used as a placeholder. However, you can customize the content to suit your needs.
                <br><br>
                To implement the expandable functionality, we use a checkbox input and its associated label. When the checkbox is checked, the content expands using CSS transitions. This technique allows for a smooth and visually appealing animation.
                <br><br>
                Expandable widgets are commonly used in web design to create collapsible sections, dropdown menus, or toggleable panels. They provide a clean and intuitive user interface, enhancing the overall user experience.
